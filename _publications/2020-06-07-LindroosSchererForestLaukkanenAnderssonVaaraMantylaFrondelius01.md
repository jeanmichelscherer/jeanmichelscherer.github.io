A reduced micromorphic model is formulated in the scope of crystal plasticity and crystalline cleavage damage. The finite strain formulation utilizes a single additional microvariable that is used to regularize localized inelastic deformation mechanisms. Damage is formulated as a strain-like variable to fit the generalized micromorphic microslip and/or microdamage based formulation. Strategies of treating slip and damage simultaneously and separately as non-local variables are investigated in terms of producing length-scale hardening and modeling localized damage flow, resulting in finite width damage bands. The results show that the micromorphic extension introduces extra-hardening in the vicinity of grain boundaries and slip localization zones for dislocation slip in polycrystals, while slip band width is regularized at sub-grain scale (i.e. single crystal level). Two ways of dealing with damage localization were identified: An indirect method based on controlling width of slip bands that act as initiation sites for damage and a direct method in which damage generalized stress regularizes damage flow together or separately of slip. Application to martensitic steel microstructure is given and the results indicate that the model can describe length-scale dependent inelastic deformation and evolution of damage.
