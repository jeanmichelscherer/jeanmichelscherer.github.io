A generic description of the nature of variables involved in constitutive models is provided. Their treatment within a finite element resolution of the set of differential equation defined by constitutive equations is described. In particular, a general form of the consistent tangent matrix is derived. Then, the proposed formalism is applied to describe the numerical implementation of a crystal elasto-plasticity constitutive model first at small strains and at finite strains thereafter. Emphasis is set on the derivation of the Jacobian and consistent tangent matrices. Numerical applications involving a rotating single crystal turbine blade and single crystal cylinders in torsion are then presented. Eventually, a non-local extension of the single crystal constitutive model based on the micromorphic approach is introduced. The striking redundancy with the conventional model is highlighted, while additional or modified terms of the jacobian and consistent matrices are derived.
