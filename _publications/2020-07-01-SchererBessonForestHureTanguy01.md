A comparison of crystal plasticity gradient theories is presented that includes thermodynamical formulation, finite element implementation and numerical validation. A reduced strain gradient crystal plasticity theory which involves the gradient of a single scalar field is presented. Rate-dependent and rate-independent settings are considered. The theory is then reformulated following first the micromorphic approach and second an augmented Lagrangian approach. Finite element implementation of the latter is detailed. Computational efficiency of the augmented Lagrangian approach is highlighted. Simulations are then performed to assess the size effects predicted by these two implementations of strain gradient plasticity. First of all numerical comparisons of these formulations are performed on single crystal wires in torsion. Saturation of the size effects induced by the micromorphic approach and absence of saturation with the augmented Lagrangian approach when sample size is decreased are demonstrated. The augmented Lagrangian model is finally applied in periodic porous unit-cells simulations at imposed stress triaxiality. A stronger size effect as compared to exisiting micromophic results is demonstrated.
